Getting Started
===============

Install Dependencies
--------------------

**For fedora, RHEL and IBM KVM :**

     $ sudo yum install ginger-base libvirt-python libvirt hddtemp \
                        libuser-python python-augeas python-netaddr\
                        python-ethtool python-ipaddr python-magic \

    # For fedora, RHEL and Power ppc
    $ sudo yum install tuned lm_sensors

    # Power ppc install the following packages
    $ sudo yum install powerpc-utils serviceable.event.provider

    # These dependencies are only required if you want to run the tests:
    $ sudo yum install pyflakes python-pep8 python-mock

**For Ubuntu (Debian-based):**

    $ sudo apt-get install ginger-base libvirt-bin python-libvirt hddtemp \
                        python-libuser python-ethtool python-augeas \
                        python-ipaddr python-magic python-netaddr

    # These dependencies are only required if you want to run the tests:
    $ sudo apt-get install pep8 pyflakes python-requests python-mock

Build and Install
-----------------

    Wok Framework Installation:
    $ ./autogen.sh --system

    $ make
    $ sudo make install   # Optional if running from the source tree

    Ginger Base:
    $ cd src/wok/plugins/gingerbase
    $ ./autogen.sh --system

    $ make
    $ sudo make install   # Optional if running from the source tree

    Ginger:
    $ cd ginger
    $ ./autogen.sh --system

    $ make
    $ sudo make install   # Optional if running from the source tree

Run
---
    $ sudo /usr/bin/wok --host=0.0.0.0

    OR

    $ sudo systemctl start wokd

*** Notes on Power policy management feature ***

The power policy management feature uses the 'tuned' service to control the
power policies of the host. Problems have been reported with this package,
depending on the host configuration, such as SELinux denials and trouble
to communicate using DBUS with the 'tuned' service started from systemd.

If you find any problems with the power policy management feature, we
recommend following these steps (all steps requires 'sudo' privileges):

- put SELinux in permissive mode for 'tuned' (required if the version of the
package 'selinux-policy' is < 3.11):

$ semanage permissive -a tuned_t

- disable the 'tuned' service from systemd and restart it by hand:

$ systemctl stop tuned.service
$ tuned -l -P -d

Remember to restart wokd service after these changes:

$ systemctl restart wokd.service

If these steps do not solve the problem, try to update all 'tuned' related
packages and the packages'selinux-policy' and 'selinux-policy-targeted'.

Test
----

    $ cd ginger
    $ make check-local # check for i18n and formatting errors
    $ sudo make check

After all tests are executed, a summary will be displayed containing any
errors/failures which might have occurred.
